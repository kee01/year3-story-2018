<h1>Michael Schumacher, early life.</h1>

<p>
I started following F1 due to Michael Schmacher. Michael had the ability to take an ordinary racing car and take it to its limit. He was able to find speed where other couldn't.
Michael Schumacher was born on the third of January 1969 to Rolf and Elisabeth Schumacher. The family move to the town of Kerpin-Manheim, a working class town near Cologne, Germany. 
It was there that the family became involved with karting. Michael, only four at the time was given a kart powered by an old lawn-mower engine by his father. 
From so humble a beginning was a World Champion's career launched. Karting became a family obsession fed by the resourcefulness of the elder Schumacher and the spirit of young Michael. 
Rolf Schumacher's mechanical ability led him to work part-time repairing other go-karts at the local track. In 1980 he traveled to Nivelles, Belgium for the World Karting Championship and 
saw a driver that impressed him deeply, that driver was Ayrton Senna. Because German regulations stated the minimum permissible age to obtain a kart racing license was 14 he 
obtained a Luxembourg license (obtainable from the age of 12). Michael was soon making a name for himself and in 1984 he won the German Junior Championship. The European championship came 
his way in 1987.
    In 1982, the young driver won the 'German Junior Kart Championship. He was only beginning to warm up.
