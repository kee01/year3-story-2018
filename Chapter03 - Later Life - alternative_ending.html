<h1>Later Life</h1>

<p>
As Michael was getting older he decided to retire. This lasted three years and he then made a comeback with the Mercedes team. The comeback was not a success it was hoped it would be.
Schumacher's first drive of the 2010 Mercedes car the Mercedes MGP W01 was at an official test in February 2010 in Valencia. He finished sixth in the first race of the season at the 
Bahrain Grand Prix. After the Malaysian race, former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher, who had finished behind his teammate in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races, 
might be "past it".Many other respected former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned "you should never write Schumacher off".
GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.
Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's 2010 car was designed for him, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.

<h2>Aternative Ending</h2>
<p>
    Towards the end of Schumacher's career he joined the Mercedes team. This propelled him into an even greater status.
    Since joining in 2010 he has won 18 grand prix with the Mercedes team and has been consistently beating his very poor rival Lewis Hamilton.
    After he retired he had a small skiing accident where he grazed his knee. He can now be found relaxing on his boat on
    the harbour in the Principality of Monaco.
