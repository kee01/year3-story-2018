<h1>Racing Career</h1>
<p>
The path to car racing started with Formula Ford or Formula Koenig, as it was known in Germany. To compete at this level Schumacher would need sponsors and lucky for him several sponsors 
including Jurgen Dik had noticed the young German. His first full year competing in the series saw him win nine out of ten rounds. Willie Weber, his future manager, was running his own 
Formula Three team and gave Michael a test in one of his cars. After seven or eight laps he was setting times 1 1/2 seconds faster than Webber's regular driver. Schumacher's 
first year in Formula Three saw him competing against future Formula 1 drivers, Karl Wendlinger and Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Wendlinger eventually nosed out his compatriots for the title. 
The next year was all Schumacher. Instead of graduating to Formula 3000 Webber placed his young prot�g� in the Mercedes junior team driving a sports car for Sauber along with his former 
Formula Three rivals. Under the watchful eyes of Jochen Neerspasch and Jochen Mass he was schooled in the art of racecar driving. During this period Schumacher learned much of what would 
later become his trademark smooth style.
Opportunity arrived when Jordan's Formula One drive Bertrand Gachot found himself in jail and Schumacher was given a test with the Irish team. His times were a revelation and he was quickly 
signed or so it was thought. Jordan wanted to sign the young driver to a three-year contract but Schumacher's advisors urged caution. Eventually a temporary deal was done and the rest as the 
saying goes is history.
Michael liked his time at Jordan and this showed in his driving style. It was also a great looking car.
